<p class="lead">Flutter is a popular open-source UI toolkit for building high-performance, cross-platform mobile and web apps. With Flutter, you can write code once and deploy it to both Android and iOS devices, as well as the web, macOS, Windows, and Linux. In this
  guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Flutter.</p>

<h2 class="display-6 mt-4">Step 1: Install Flutter</h2>
<p class="lead">To get started with Flutter, you'll need to install it on your computer. Here's how:</p>
<ol class="lead">
  <li>Download the Flutter SDK from the official <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install">Flutter Website</a>.</li>
  <li>Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.</li>
  <li>Add the Flutter SDK to your system path. To do this, open your terminal and type:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code-block">export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/bin"</pre>
<p class="lead">4. Verify that Flutter is installed correctly by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-block">flutter doctor</pre>
<p class="lead">This command will check your system and show you any issues that need to be resolved before you can start building apps with Flutter.</p>

<h2 class="display-6 mt-4">Step 2: Set up an IDE</h2>
<p class="lead">Flutter can be used with a variety of IDEs, including Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ IDEA. In this guide, we'll use Visual Studio Code (coz that's what I use).</p>
<ol class="lead">
  <li>Download and install Visual Studio Code from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">official website</a>.</li>
  <li>Install the Flutter and Dart plugins for Visual Studio Code. To do this, open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for "Flutter" and "Dart" and install the plugins.</li>
  <li>Once the plugins are installed, you can create a new Flutter project by going to the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing "Flutter: New Project". Follow the prompts to create a new project.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="display-6 mt-4">Step 3: Build your first Flutter app</h2>
<p class="lead">Now that you have everything set up, it's time to build your first Flutter app. Here's how:</p>
<ol class="lead">
  <li>Open the main.dart file in your project's lib folder.</li>
  <li>Replace the default code with the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code-block-simple">
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My First Flutter App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Welcome to Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</pre>
<p class="lead">This code creates a basic Flutter app that displays a "Hello World" message on the screen.</p>
<ol class="lead" start="3">
  <li>Save the file and run the app by typing the following command in your terminal:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code-block">flutter run</pre>

<!-- Ezoic -  before_conclusion - long_content -->
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109"> </div>
<!-- End Ezoic -  before_conclusion - long_content -->

<p class="lead">This will launch the app in an emulator or on a connected device.</p>
<p class="lead">Congratulations! You've just built your first Flutter app.</p>
