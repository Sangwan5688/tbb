<p class="body-text">If you're an Android user, you might have heard of custom ROMs. Every smartphone comes with a default ROM pre-installed. It can be AOSP-based with not a lot of added features, more commonly referred to as Stock Android, or it can be a custom skin from
  a particular brand. Samsung phones, for example, use a custom UX based on Android called OneUI. Xiaomi phones use MIUI, Oppo uses ColorOS, OnePlus uses OxygenOS, etc. Every ROM looks different and has a different set of features.</p>
<p class="body-text">While some may like a certain UI, others may not. Some users prefer a feature-rich interface with the ability to install themes and modify system elements while some may want a clean, simple experience with no frills. This is where installing a custom
  Android ROM comes into the picture.</p>
