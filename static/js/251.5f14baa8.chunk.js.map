If you aren't sure what those are check out{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"/blogs/arm64_vs_armeabi/\">Arm64 vs Armeabi</Link>. While the\n        average user might not think too much about what type of processor their\n        device has, developers and power users may need to know which one they\n        have in order to install certain apps or customize their devices.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        The easiest way to check which processor your mobile device has is to\n        use a system information app. These apps are available in the Google\n        Play Store and can provide a wealth of information about your device,\n        including the processor type.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"body-head mt-4\">\n        How to Check Using a System Information App\n      </h2>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        There are lots of mobile apps out there that you can use to check your\n        mobile processor. Some of the popular system information app are{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpuid.cpu_z\">\n          CPU-Z\n        </a>\n        ,{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inkwired.droidinfo\">\n          Droid Hardware Info\n        </a>\n        . You can download them from Google Play Store and install it on your\n        device. Once you launch the app, it will provide you with detailed\n        information about your device's processor, including the type and\n        architecture.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        Another way to check which processor your mobile device has is to use\n        the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) tool. This method requires a bit more\n        technical knowledge, but it can be useful if you don't want to install\n        an app on your device.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"body-head mt-4\">How to Check Using ADB</h2>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        To use ADB, you will need to enable USB debugging on your device and\n        connect it to your computer using a USB cable. Once you have done this,\n        you can open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer and\n        enter the following command:\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"code-block\">adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi</p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        This command will output the processor type for your device.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"body-head mt-4\">Conclusion</h2>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        Knowing which processor your mobile device has can be useful for\n        developers and power users who need to install specific apps or\n        customize their devices. You can use a system information app or the ADB\n        tool to check which processor your device has. Additionally, it's\n        important to be aware of the differences between ARMv7 and ARMv8 and how\n        they can affect your device's performance and compatibility with certain\n        apps.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["how_to_check_phone_processor","_jsxs","_Fragment","children","className","_jsx","Link","to","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
