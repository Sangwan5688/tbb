These\n        terms refer to the type of processor architecture that your device uses.\n        Knowing which app to download can be confusing, but understanding the\n        differences between the two can help you make the right choice.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* <!-- adblock --> */}\n\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        Firstly, let's understand what these terms mean. ARM is a type of\n        processor architecture that is widely used in smartphones, tablets, and\n        other mobile devices. It stands for \"Advanced RISC Machine,\" and it is a\n        type of processor that is known for its energy efficiency and\n        performance.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        <b>\n          <b>Armeabi</b>\n        </b>{\" \"}\n        is an older version of the ARM processor architecture. It was first\n        introduced in 1995 and was widely used in early Android devices. It is a\n        32-bit processor that is now obsolete and is no longer supported by many\n        app developers.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        <b>\n          <b>Arm64</b>\n        </b>\n        , on the other hand, is a newer and more advanced version of the ARM\n        architecture. It is a 64-bit processor that provides better performance\n        and energy efficiency than its predecessor. It is widely used in modern\n        Android devices and is the recommended processor architecture for\n        downloading most apps.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* <!-- adblock --> */}\n\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        If, however, your device uses an older 32-bit processor, then you should\n        download the armeabi version of the app. This will ensure that the app\n        is compatible with your device and runs smoothly. However, it's\n        important to note that armeabi is an older architecture and is no longer\n        supported by many app developers. So, if possible, it's recommended that\n        you upgrade to a device that uses a 64-bit processor.\n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"body-subhead mt-4\">\n        <b>What about universal version?</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        In addition to arm64 and armeabi, there is also a universal version of\n        an app that is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. The\n        universal version is designed to provide maximum compatibility with all\n        devices, regardless of the type of processor architecture they use.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        The universal version of an app is also known as the <b>\"fat binary\"</b>{\" \"}\n        version. It includes both the arm64 and armeabi versions of the app,\n        which allows it to run on devices that use either processor\n        architecture. This means that if you download the universal version of\n        an app, you won't have to worry about whether your device uses a 32-bit\n        or 64-bit processor.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        The downside to the universal version of an app is that it can take up\n        more storage space on your device since it includes both versions of the\n        app. Additionally, the universal version may not always provide the best\n        performance since it is designed to be compatible with both processor\n        architectures.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* <!-- adblock --> */}\n\n      <h3 className=\"body-subhead mt-4\">\n        <b>So, which version should you download?</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        If your device uses a 64-bit processor, it's recommended that you\n        download the arm64 version of the app. This will ensure that the app\n        runs smoothly and provides optimal performance. Most modern devices use\n        arm64 processors, so it's likely that you'll need to download the arm64\n        version of most apps. However, if the app is not available in arm64, or\n        if you're unsure which version to download, you can opt for the\n        universal version. If your device uses a 32-bit processor, then you can\n        download either the armeabi or universal version of the app.\n      </p>\n\n      {/* <!-- adblock --> */}\n\n      <h3 className=\"body-subhead mt-4\">\n        <b>Conclusion</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p className=\"body-text\">\n        In summary, the decision to download either arm64 or armeabi version of\n        an app depends on the processor architecture of your device. If you have\n        a 64-bit processor, then download the arm64 version, and if you have a\n        32-bit processor, then download the armeabi version. The universal\n        version of an app can provide maximum compatibility with all devices,\n        but it may not always provide the best performance. If possible, it's\n        recommended that you download the arm64 version if your device supports\n        it. However, if you're unsure which version to download or if the arm64\n        version is not available, you can opt for the universal version for\n        maximum compatibility. Understanding these differences can help you make\n        the right choice and ensure that you get the best performance from your\n        apps.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["arm64_vs_armeabi","_jsxs","_Fragment","children","_jsx","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
